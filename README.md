# Docker Environment for Wikistream

This is a demo environment for Wikistream, a Python package to stream Wikimedia edits (['wikistream'](https://github.com/timescale/wikistream)).

It includes TimescaleDB, Grafana and Wikistream as three services in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/timescale/wikistream-docker
```

Bring up the services with `docker-compose`:

```
docker-compose up
```

Once everything has started you can visit `http://localhost:3000` to login to Grafana.

The username and password are both `admin`.

If you'd like to connect directly to TimescaleDB use `psql`:

```
psql -U postgres -d wikistream
```

Note that this assumes you aren't running PostgreSQL locally, as the TimescaleDB container
will attempt to use `localhost` with the default port of `5432`.

If you have a local instance of PostgreSQL running you'll need to shut it down and try `docker-compose up` again.

## Contributing
